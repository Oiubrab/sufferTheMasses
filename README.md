Building a Strategy Game that more accurately represents real politics and economics.

This repository currently contains early prototypes for an emergent simulation.
The `simulation.py` module defines data classes for agents and world tiles as well
as helper functions to build a sparse world grid.

Run `example_usage.py` to load an agent definition from `characters/karu.json`,
place that agent into a simple world, modify its state, and save the updated
JSON back to disk.
